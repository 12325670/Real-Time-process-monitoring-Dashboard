# Real-Time-process-monitoring-Dashboard 
Author:  <br> Subhash kumar  <br> Ankit Kumar <br> Abhay Singh <br> 

1. Project Overview

Goal: Develop a Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard to track, analyze, and visualize ongoing processes in real-time. The dashboard should display live data, provide alerts, and offer insights through charts and graphs.

Expected Outcomes:

A user-friendly dashboard displaying real-time process metrics.

Smooth data collection, processing, and visualization.

Alerts and notifications for anomalies or process failures.


Scope:

Processes to Monitor: Can include system processes (CPU, memory usage), industrial processes (IoT sensor data), or business processes (user activity, financial transactions).

Users: Operators, system administrators, business analysts.

Data Sources: APIs, databases, sensors, logs, system metrics.

2. Module-Wise Breakdown

The project can be divided into three core modules:

1. Data Collection Module (Backend & Processing)

Purpose: Collects data in real-time from different sources like APIs, system logs, sensors, or databases.

Role: Ensures smooth and continuous data retrieval.


2. Data Processing & Analysis Module

Purpose: Processes incoming data, applies filters, detects anomalies, and transforms raw data into usable insights.

Role: Ensures real-time computation, generates alerts, and stores relevant data.


3. Visualization & User Interface Module

Purpose: Displays processed data on a dashboard with interactive charts, tables, and alerts.

Role: Provides a clear, real-time view for users.

3. Functionalities

1. Data Collection Module

✅ Fetches data from APIs, IoT devices, databases, or logs.
✅ Supports multiple formats (JSON, CSV, SQL, MQTT).
✅ Stores data temporarily before processing.

Example:

System Monitoring: Fetch CPU usage from a system API every second.

IoT Monitoring: Collects sensor data from MQTT brokers.


2. Data Processing & Analysis Module

✅ Filters out noise and redundant data.
✅ Detects anomalies based on thresholds or ML models.
✅ Stores processed data in a database for visualization.

Example:

Business Process: Flags transactions over ₹1,00,000 as potential fraud.

Industrial Process: Detects abnormal temperature variations in a machine.


3. Visualization & User Interface Module

✅ Real-time dashboard with graphs and tables.
✅ Live alerts and notifications for critical events.
✅ Custom filters to view historical or specific data.

Example:

System Monitoring: Displays CPU, RAM, and disk usage on a line chart.

Industrial Process: Shows real-time pressure and temperature graphs.

4. Technology Recommendations

Programming Languages:

Backend: Python (FastAPI, Flask) or Node.js

Frontend: React.js, Vue.js, or Dash (Python)

Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB (for NoSQL needs)


Libraries & Tools:

Data Collection: Requests (API), Paho MQTT (IoT), psutil (system monitoring)

Processing & Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for ML-based anomaly detection)

Visualization: Plotly, D3.js, Chart.js, Matplotlib

Real-time Updates: WebSockets (Socket.io), Firebase, Redis

5. Execution Plan

Phase 1: Planning & Setup

✅ Identify processes to monitor.
✅ Define required metrics (e.g., CPU %, temperature, transaction speed).
✅ Choose technology stack.

Phase 2: Backend Development (Data Collection & Processing)

✅ Develop scripts to collect real-time data from sources.
✅ Store data in a database or cache (Redis).
✅ Implement anomaly detection (if needed).

Phase 3: Frontend Development (Visualization Dashboard)

✅ Design UI using React, Vue, or Dash.
✅ Implement real-time graphs and alerts.
✅ Connect frontend with backend API.

Phase 4: Testing & Optimization

✅ Test with real data sources.
✅ Optimize for performance (reduce API calls, cache results).
✅ Fix UI issues and refine visualization.

Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance

✅ Deploy backend (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
✅ Deploy frontend (Netlify, Vercel).
✅ Set up monitoring for uptime and performance.

Tips for Efficiency

✔ Use async processing to handle real-time data smoothly.
✔ Optimize database queries with indexing and caching.
✔ Use WebSockets instead of polling for real-time updates.
✔ Automate alerts to notify users via email or SMS.
